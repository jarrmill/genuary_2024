This code repo is a playground to follow Daniel Shiffman's fantastic book "The Nature of Code".

Instead of using Processing or P5.js like the book, I've opted to use Pixi.js, as it is more common in production settings. It lacks some of the functions supplied by Processing (such as vectors), so I am also writing some basic classes as needed.

This is for fun, and not for any class or demo purposes. Don't be expecting production code here!
